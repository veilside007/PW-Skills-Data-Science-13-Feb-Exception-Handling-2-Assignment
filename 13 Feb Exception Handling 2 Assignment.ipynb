    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions and custom exceptions. When creating a custom exception, it is advisable to subclass the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses to ensure that your custom exception inherits important properties and behaviors from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why we use the `Exception` class as the base class when creating a custom exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inheritance of Properties and Methods**: By subclassing the `Exception` class, your custom exception inherits properties and methods that are useful for exception handling. These include attributes such as `args` (the tuple of arguments passed to the exception), `with_traceback()` (to set or change the exception's traceback), and methods like `__str__()` (to return a string representation of the exception) and `__repr__()` (to return a string representation suitable for debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistency and Familiarity**: Subclassing the `Exception` class provides consistency and familiarity for other developers who may encounter your custom exception. Since `Exception` is the base class for all exceptions in Python, using it as the base class for your custom exception makes your code more predictable and understandable to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compatibility with Exception Handling Mechanisms**: Subclassing `Exception` ensures that your custom exception can be handled using the same exception handling mechanisms (`try`, `except`, `finally`, etc.) that are used for built-in exceptions. This allows for consistent and uniform error handling across different parts of your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Future Compatibility**: Subclassing `Exception` future-proofs your custom exception against changes in the Python language. If new features or behaviors are introduced for exceptions in future versions of Python, your custom exception will automatically inherit these changes by virtue of its subclass relationship with `Exception`."

    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is an essential aspect of writing robust and reliable Python code. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Catch Specific Exceptions**: Instead of catching generic exceptions like `Exception`, catch specific exceptions that you expect might occur. This helps in better understanding and handling of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use `try-except` Blocks**: Wrap the code that might raise an exception inside a `try` block and handle the exception(s) using one or more `except` blocks. This helps in separating the normal code flow from the error-handling logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Bare Except Clauses**: Avoid using bare `except` clauses (`except:`) without specifying the exception type. Bare except clauses can catch unexpected exceptions, including system-exiting exceptions like `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`, which can hide bugs and make debugging difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully**: Handle exceptions gracefully by providing appropriate error messages or fallback mechanisms. Users should receive meaningful error messages that guide them on how to resolve the issue or continue with the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use `finally` Blocks for Cleanup**: Use `finally` blocks to execute cleanup code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. Common use cases for `finally` blocks include closing files, releasing resources, or cleaning up temporary data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Avoid deep nesting of `try-except` blocks, as it can make the code difficult to read and maintain. Consider refactoring the code into smaller, more manageable functions or using context managers (`with` statement) to handle resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Log Exceptions**: Log exceptions using Python's logging module or other logging frameworks. Logging exceptions helps in debugging issues, monitoring application health, and tracking errors in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Reraise Exceptions Appropriately**: If you catch an exception but cannot handle it completely, consider reraising the exception using the `raise` statement without any arguments. This preserves the original traceback information and allows higher-level code to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Document Exception Handling**: Document the exceptions that a function or method may raise, along with the conditions under which they occur. This helps other developers understand the expected behavior of the code and handle exceptions effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Test Exception Handling**: Write unit tests to verify that exception handling code behaves as expected under different scenarios. Test both the cases where exceptions are raised and where they are not to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write more robust, maintainable, and error-resilient Python code that handles exceptions effectively."
